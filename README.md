# Josh's LeetCode Repository
This repository contains my implementations and solutions to various LeetCode challenges. All are in C# targeted to C# 7.x against DotNetCore 2.x.  

**DISCLAIMER:** *By no means are these necessarily the best, fastest, concise, or optimal solutions to these challenges. The majority are my naive or somewhat educated or expierence driven designs. A few I used external resources (e.g. Wikipedia) for algorithm research.*  
  
The solution contains two main projects: Solutions and Tests.   Both follow the same hierarchical folder structure with their respective namespaces also doing so.  

## Build Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/photo-bro/LeetCode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/photo-bro/LeetCode)
  
## Solutions  
 - Implementations for the given challenge 
 - Helper classes with the common data structures (e.g. TreeNode)

  
## Tests  
- XUnit unit tests to verify the validity of the associated challenge solution
